                                    <p>My name is Thomas Kremer, I am a 47 year old from Hillsborough, North Carolina.  I am the hospitality leader at my church,
                                          I manage a team of volunteers who set up and bring the food and snacks that are served before service and during any outside
                                          events or functions that the church may host.  In addition I also decide the look and the feel of the entrance to the service area
                                          of the church based on what the lord puts on my heart as far as decor.  I am also responsible for operating the computer audio 
                                          system that displays the lyrics for the songs that the worship team sings as well as the scriptures and any other information that
                                          might aid the parishioners in keeping up during the service.  I volunteer giving out food to those who are less fortunate or in 
                                          need every Saturday except for the third Saturday as well as the fith Saturday on the months that have five weeks in them.  On 
                                          the third Saturday the head of the food ministry goes to feed the homeless under the bridge in Durham and the fith Saturday I 
                                          take off because everybody needs a break now and then.  I lost my step-father who was the only father I have ever known since
                                          the age of about two years old about three and half years ago and my mother just recently passed away in August of this year 
                                          shortly after her 71st birthday.  I currently live with my Uncle, one of my cousins and a family friend who is staying with us 
                                          temporarily while he works on getting his credit score high enough to get financing for a new home.  I am attending Bethel Tech
                                          and taking Full Stack Web Development in the hopes to better the situation for my family as well as myself later down the road 
                                          and also to live the dream that I was denied because of health issues throughout my life.  It is because of Gods' grace, mercy 
                                          and goodness that I am not only still here on his beautiful creation but that I have this oppurtunity in front of me. </p>
